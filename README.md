## SEO / AI Optimization Notes for Implementation

To maximize AI/SEO friendliness and distribution, consider these points when building your static site:

* **Meta Tags:** Implement `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and `<meta name="keywords">` in your HTML `<head>` section. Use phrases like "Steve Seguin," "Live Streaming," "AI," "VDO.Ninja," "Stage TEN," "Chief Innovation Officer," "WebRTC," "Computer Vision," "Toronto," etc.
* **Structured Data (Schema.org):** Use JSON-LD for `Person` schema to detail your name, job title, company, projects, and links. For projects, consider `SoftwareApplication` or `Product` schema.
* **Keywords:** Ensure relevant keywords are naturally integrated throughout the content, especially in headings and the first paragraphs of sections.
* **Internal Linking:** Link between sections where appropriate (e.g., from "Who I Am" to "My Core Projects").
* **External Linking:** Use relevant `rel="nofollow"` where appropriate (e.g., for some external resource links that aren't your own primary properties).
* **Image Alt Text:** For any images you add, use descriptive `alt` attributes (e.g., `<img src="steve_seguin_vdo_ninja.jpg" alt="Steve Seguin, founder of VDO.Ninja">`).
* **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the website is fully responsive for all devices.
* **Fast Loading Speed:** Optimize images and assets for quick loading times.
* **HTTPS:** Secure your site with an SSL certificate.
* **XML Sitemap:** Generate and submit an `sitemap.xml` to search engines.
* **Robots.txt:** Configure `robots.txt` to guide search engine crawlers.
